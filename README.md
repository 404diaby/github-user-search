## Features


- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- Persist theme with localStorage



The GitHub users API endpoint is `https://api.github.com/users/:username`. So, if you wanted to search for the Octocat profile, you'd be able to make a request to `https://api.github.com/users/octocat`.

### Expected behaviour

On first load, show the profile information for `404diaby` (me).

Display an error message, if no user is found when a new search is made.
If a GitHub user hasn't added their name, show their username where the name would be without the @ symbol and again below with the @ symbol.
If a GitHub user's bio is empty, show the text "This profile has no bio" with transparency added.

If any of the location, website, twitter, or company properties are empty, show the text "Not Available" with transparency added.
Website, twitter, and company information should all be links to those resaources. For the company link, it should remove the @ symbol and link to the company page on GitHub. For Octocat, with @github being returned for the company, this would lead to a URL of `https://github.com/github`.
